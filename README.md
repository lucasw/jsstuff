Javascript resources
====================

I went through the http://codeacademy.com javascript and jquery courses, and might do the html/css one as well.  Also the Udacity 3d graphics course though I'm not doing any three.js stuff here yet.  It probably is a lot slower than the traditional method of finding text tutorials and api documentation via google but it is interesting to try this approach.
